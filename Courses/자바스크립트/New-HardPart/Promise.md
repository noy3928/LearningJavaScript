## Introducing the readablity enhancer - Promises

- special objects built into Javascript that get returned immediately when we make a call to web browser API/feature that's set up to return promises.
- Promises act as a placeholder for the data we hope to get back from the web browser feature's background work.
- we also attach the functionality we want to defer running until that background work is done(using the built in .then method)
- promise objects will automatically trigger that functionality to run
