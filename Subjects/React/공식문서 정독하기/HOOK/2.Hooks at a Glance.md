# 2.Hooks at a Glance

## useState

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react"

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- React will preserve this state between re-renders.

- You can use the State Hook more than once in a single component:

```javascript
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42)
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState("banana")
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: "Learn Hooks" }])
  // ...
}
```

Q : hook의 이름은 왜 Hook이 되었는가?  
=> Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Effect Hook

You’ve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. We call these operations “side effects” (or “effects” for short) because they can affect other components and can’t be done during rendering.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
